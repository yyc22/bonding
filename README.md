# Polar and Nonpolar Covalent Bonds Simulation - User Guide

## Overview
This simulation helps high school chemistry students understand the concepts of polar and nonpolar covalent bonds through an interactive visualization of electronegativity differences between elements.

## Features
- Interactive periodic table with color-coded electronegativity values
- Element selection functionality to analyze bonds between different elements
- Visual representation of electron sharing in different bond types
- Educational content explaining electronegativity and bond polarity
- Tooltips providing information about each element

## How to Use
1. Open the `index.html` file in any modern web browser (Chrome, Firefox, Edge, Safari)
2. Click on elements in the periodic table to select them (maximum 2 elements)
3. View the electronegativity difference and bond analysis
4. Observe the visualization of electron sharing based on bond type
5. Explore different element combinations to understand how electronegativity affects bonding
6. Use the educational tabs to learn more about different bond types

## Technical Information
- This simulation runs entirely in the browser and requires no server setup
- All data is embedded directly in the JavaScript files
- Compatible with all modern browsers and devices (desktop and mobile)

## Educational Content
The simulation includes detailed explanations of:
- Electronegativity and the Pauling scale
- Nonpolar covalent bonds (electronegativity difference < 0.5)
- Polar covalent bonds (electronegativity difference between 0.5 and 1.7)
- Ionic bonds (electronegativity difference > 1.7)

## Files Included
- `index.html` - Main HTML file to open in browser
- `css/styles.css` - Styling for the simulation
- `js/` - JavaScript files for simulation functionality
- `data/` - Data files for electronegativity values

## Troubleshooting
If the simulation doesn't load properly:
- Make sure all files are extracted from the zip archive
- Try using a different web browser
- Check that JavaScript is enabled in your browser

## Credits
Created for high school chemistry education to help students understand the important concept of bond polarity based on electronegativity differences.
